                        <p class="text_p1"> &ensp; I am Nilufar Kurbonova, a 20-year-old student from Samarkand, Uzbekistan, currently pursuing my bachelor's degree at Inha University in South Korea. <br> &ensp;&ensp;To share a bit about myself, I'm enjoy drawing, playing
                            the guitar, and basketball.On a personal note, though I appreciate various forms of art, novels don't quite capture my attention. Additionally, I like spending time outdoors, especially hiking and exploring stunning places
                            during my travels..
                            <br> &ensp; As an ambivert, I strike a balance between socializing and introspection.</p>
